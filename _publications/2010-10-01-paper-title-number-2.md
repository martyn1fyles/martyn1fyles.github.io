Abstract:
Understanding variability in clinical symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 community infections is key in management of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Here we bring together four large and diverse datasets deriving from routine testing, a population-representative household survey and participatory mobile surveillance in the United Kingdom and use cutting-edge unsupervised classification techniques from statistics and machine learning to characterise symptom phenotypes among symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive community cases. We explore commonalities across datasets and by age bands. While we observe separation due to the total number of symptoms experienced by cases, we also see a separation of symptoms into gastrointestinal, respiratory and other types, and different symptom co-occurrence patterns moving from young to elderly cases. This is expected to have implications for identification and management of community SARS-CoV-2 cases.
