I was a graduate teaching assistant in Random Models - a second year course in statistics/probability for undergraduates in the Department of Mathematics. My role was to assist students one-to-one in weekly problems classes, where they would attempt material from the course. Random models is a course covering basic stochastic processes, such as: random walks, branching processes and renewal equations.
